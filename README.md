# SunnySideApp

SunnySideApp is an android app built as part of my internship at Hasura. For a demo of the app view the [video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvtKntlitCU) The idea behind building this app was to have a ToDo app that could help me decide daily activities without having to move to another app for checking things like weather.

### The initial visualisation was done with [proto.io](https://proto.io/), which looked like this:

### And this is how the app turned out to be:

The app ~~has~~ had the following features:
1. ToDo organiser
2. Weather monitor
3. Split-screen view
4. Multi-device support (Thanks to Hasura)


__The app won't work now as the required keys for Hasura API have expired.__
